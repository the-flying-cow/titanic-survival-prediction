# Logistic Regression ML Project
A simple machine learning project built using Logistic Regression in Jupyter on Titanic Survival prediction dataset.

## Description
This project trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression model on the 'train.csv'. It includes the original notebook and a cleaned 'src/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.py' script to run the pipeline.

## Setup
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
## Run the project

In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the root folder and execute the following 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then run, 

```bash
python -m src.Titanic_Survival_Prediction
```
If you are inside the src folder, then run

```bash
python Titanic_Survival_Prediction
```
